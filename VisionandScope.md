# Vision and Scope for ExamRelief
## **Part 1: Business Requirements**
#### 1.1 Background

This project aims to create an app for Students to managing their mental health and deadlines in the run-up, and during, their exam periods. This product can provide help to a group of people very susceptible to mental health issues in times of high stress and pressure. A premium but low one-time charge for this app can keep it accessible to students and return the investment made to the project by sponsors. This money will also help developers and deployers maintain the app.

#### 1.2 Business Opportunity

Apps such as 'Mind' or 'Calm' offer extensive mental health management features to a wide audience of users such as guided meditation. However, the main shortcoming of this app is it's wide audience. Many users of these apps would benefit from having an experience personal to them, as mental health issues are very personal. The app would occupy a clear gap in the Mental Health app market as it specialises for students, but has a large audience nonetheless. Furthermore, University campus's offer easy ways to access and advertise to potential users. Students need help manging their stress, anxiety along with their workload. This app offers a way to somewhat alleviate or ease these issues.

#### 1.5 Vision statement

For Students who struggle with anxiety and/or stress during their exam periods or have issues managing their deadlines, ExamRelief is a mobile application that will provide services that assist students in the run up and during exam periods. Features include, study scheduling, deadline tracking, a feed or recipes, exercises and anxiety managing techniques. These techniques include guided meditation and grounding activities. This feed will be customizable and will refresh daily. The app will also include study tips such as advice for flashcards or past exam papers. Unlike current competitors such as Calm or Mind, our product is tailored towards students to give the audience a more tailored experience. The study aspect of our product aims to provide users with the tools to combat a significant source of student anxiety and stress. The mental health focus gives our product an edge above other study or exam apps.

#### 1.6 Business Risks

| Risks                   | Consequences                                                 | Contingencies                                           |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Low initial downloads   | Less money to spend on maintenance and extra features        | Lowering cost at launch to attract high amount of users |
| High maintenance costs  | Lower profit in the long run. Could cause project failure over a long enough time period. | Offering premium features to increase revenue           |
| Low user retention rate | Reduces growth of users due to less referrals and lower reviews. | Focus on bug fixing and respond to user feedback        |

  

#### 1.7 Business Assumptions and Dependencies

- Student union presence is effective for gaining users.
  - If this is incorrect, user targets will not be met. May need to approach different forms of advertisement.
- Students see the 99p price as reasonable.
  - If incorrect, users targets wont be met. Price could be lowered or free and premium tiers could be explored.
- Growth in users in consistent month on month.
  - While growth may be exponential, it may also drop after launch. Advertising efforts may need to be increased, or other methods to grow users, such as referrals, may need to be explored.
- Users continue to use outside of exam periods
  - If incorrect, this could result in fluctuations in usage quarterly. This results in an unstable revenue stream. May need to focus on features attractive to users who aren't studying for exams.
